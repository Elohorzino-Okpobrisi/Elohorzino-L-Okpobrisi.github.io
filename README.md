## Introduction
In this project, I cleaned, analysed and visualised the dataset containing road accidents recorded in the United Kingdom from 2021 to 2022. Leveraging on excel, I cleaned and analysed the dataset and after it was satisfactory, I utilised Power BI to create measures, which i used in efficent visualisation of the analysed data. This is the breakdown of the flow of the project. 

## Data Used

**Data -** Road accidents in United Kingdom data with over 300,000 rows from 2021 to 2022.

**Data Cleaning & Analysis -** Microsoft Excel

**Data Visualisation -** Microsoft PowerBI

## Questions

1. What is the overall trend in the number of road accidents over the years?
2. Which geographic locations or areas have the highest number of road accidents?
3. Are there any patterns or trends in the types of vehicles involved in accidents?
4. Is there a correlation between certain weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog) and the occurrence of accidents?
5. Can we identify any hotspot areas where accidents are more concentrated?
6. Are there any notable differences in accident patterns between urban and rural areas?
7. Are there any particular road types or conditions that are associated with a higher frequency of accidents?
8. What is the distribution of accident severity levels (e.g., minor, moderate, severe) in the dataset?

## Findings

- There are more accidents in Urban areas.
- Cars had the highest accidents (155,804) while Agro Vehicles had the lowest (399).
- 2022 had a reduced amount of accidents in comparison to 2021.
- 73.84% of accidents in the UK happen during the day.
- There only 2855 fatal casualties in 2022 which was a 33.3% decrease from 2021.
- Single Carriageway had the highest occurrences of accidents by road type.

## Conclusions

Cleaning and analysing this dataset was a rewarding experience. This project has not only deepened my understanding of road safety but also allowed me to enhance my analytical skills. Exploring seasonal variation, identifying intersection hotspots, analyzing driver distraction and speeding trends, addressing vulnerabilities of road users, and studying nighttime accidents have sharpened my ability to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets. This project showcased my ability to efficently clean and analyse datasets involving real-world challenges.
